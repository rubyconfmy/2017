        <p>
          All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at our conference are required to agree with the following code of conduct.

          We expect cooperation from all participants.
        </p>

        <h1 class="arrow">Need Help?</h1><hr class="left">
        <p>If you feel your safety is in jeopardy, please do not hesitate to contact local law enforment by dialing <a href="tel:999">999</a> immediately.</p>
        <p>Talk to our conference staffs on duty so they can assist you ASAP. They can be identified easily by their branded t-shirts or Staff name tags.</p>
        <p>If you wish to report a harassment or abuse, please again contact our staffs directly or send an email to <a href="mailto:abuse@rubyconf.my">abuse@rubyconf.my</a>.</p>

        <p><br /></p>

        <h1 class="arrow">The Quick Version</h1><hr class="left">
        <p>Our conference is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. </p>
        <p>We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media.</p>
        <p>Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference organisers. If the situation is deemed severe, we will not hesitate to contact hotel/venue security or local law enforement.</p>

        <p><br /></p>

        <h1 class="arrow">The Less Quick Version</h1><hr class="left">
        <p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>
        <p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>
        <p>Sponsors and organizing partners are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, they should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.</p>
        <p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.</p>
        <p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff immediately. Conference staff can be identified as they'll be wearing branded t-shirts or Staff name tags.</p>
        <p>Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance.</p>
        <p>We expect participants to follow these rules at conference and workshop venues and conference-related social events.</p>
